If you are travelling with an infant younger than two years of age (0-24 months), you can bring baby food, milk, formula, water, juice and other baby items in your carry-on baggage. Certain powders and granular materials (e.g. baby powder) in your carry-on are limited to a total quantity of 350 ml or less. Gel and ice packs can be brought on board, if they are being used to refrigerate baby food, milk, breast milk, formula, water or juice for infants younger than two years of age.

If you are travelling with an infant younger than two years of age (0-24 months), you can bring baby food, milk, formula, water, juice and other baby items in your carry-on baggage. Certain powders and granular materials (e.g. baby powder) in your carry-on are limited to a total quantity of 350 ml or less. Gel and ice packs can be brought on board, if they are being used to refrigerate baby food, milk, breast milk, formula, water or juice for infants younger than two years of age. Passengers flying with or without their child can bring breast milk in quantities greater than 100 ml provided it is presented to the screening officer for inspection prior to screening. Any exempted liquids, such as medications, baby formula or breast milk, should be packed so that they can easily be removed from carry-on baggage for inspection. However, we recommend that these items be properly labeled (manufacturer's name or pharmaceutical label identifying the medication). You can pack toys in your child’s carry-on baggage, but leave toys that look like weapons (e.g. water guns, toy grenades, etc.) at home.","matchConfidenceLevel":"LOW","matchConfidence":0.4172337055206299}]}},"webhookStatus":null,"outputAudio":{"type":"Buffer","data":[]},"outputAudioConfig":null},null,null]

Screening officers will need to inspect strollers, infant carriers and car seats. All baby food or drinks, including formula, must be presented to the screening officer for inspection. Children’s carry-ons, including diaper bags, should be placed on the conveyor belt for security screening. Keep any MP3 players (e.g. iPods), portable handheld game consoles, tablets and smartphones in your carry-on. Let your child walk through the metal detector if they are able to do so on their own.

If you are travelling with an infant younger than two years of age (0-24 months), you can bring baby food, milk, formula, water, juice and other baby items in your carry-on baggage. Certain powders and granular materials (e.g. baby powder) in your carry-on are limited to a total quantity of 350 ml or less. Gel and ice packs can be brought on board, if they are being used to refrigerate baby food, milk, breast milk, formula, water or juice for infants younger than two years of age. Passengers flying with or without their child can bring breast milk in quantities greater than 100 ml provided it is presented to the screening officer for inspection prior to screening. Any exempted liquids, such as medications, baby formula or breast milk, should be packed so that they can easily be removed from carry-on baggage for inspection. However, we recommend that these items be properly labeled (manufacturer's name or pharmaceutical label identifying the medication).

If you are travelling with an infant younger than two years of age (0-24 months), you can bring baby food, milk, formula, water, juice and other baby items in your carry-on baggage. Certain powders and granular materials (e.g. baby powder) in your carry-on are limited to a total quantity of 350 ml or less. Gel and ice packs can be brought on board, if they are being used to refrigerate baby food, milk, breast milk, formula, water or juice for infants younger than two years of age. Passengers flying with or without their child can bring breast milk in quantities greater than 100 ml provided it is presented to the screening officer for inspection prior to screening. Any exempted liquids, such as medications, baby formula or breast milk, should be packed so that they can easily be removed from carry-on baggage for inspection. However, we recommend that these items be properly labeled (manufacturer's name or pharmaceutical label identifying the medication).

When you arrive at the checkpoint, check if the Family/Special Needs lane is available. This lane features screening equipment that can accommodate larger items, and screening officers who offer additional assistance to passengers needing more time or help with their belongings to get through security. Screening officers will need to inspect strollers, infant carriers and car seats. All baby food or drinks, including formula, must be presented to the screening officer for inspection. Children’s carry-ons, including diaper bags, should be placed on the conveyor belt for security screening. Keep any MP3 players (e.g. iPods), portable handheld game consoles, tablets and smartphones in your carry-on. Let your child walk through the metal detector if they are able to do so on their own.
